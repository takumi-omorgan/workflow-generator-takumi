# start

The kit's front door. `/start` (and its alias `/next`) answers one
question — **what do I run now?** — by inspecting project state and
recommending the next appropriate skill, rather than making the user
remember the full skill inventory. It is the router half of the
unified control model in
[ADR-048](../../design/adr/adr-048-unified-workflow-control.md); the
canonical model lives in
[`docs/workflow-control.md`](../../docs/workflow-control.md).

## When to use this skill

- **At the start of a session**, to be told where the project stands
  and what to do next.
- **After finishing a step**, instead of recalling the handoff.
- **Any time the next move is unclear.**

`/start` and `/next` are the same skill. Use `/start` on a fresh or
empty project (it doubles as onboarding); use `/next` mid-flow. Either
name works at any time.

If you already know the exact skill you want, just run it — `/start` is
a convenience, not a required gateway.

## What this skill does not do

- Does not mutate GitHub. It reads state and recommends; it never opens
  PRs, creates issues, pushes, or closes milestones.
- Does not duplicate `/resume`. `/resume` *briefs* you from
  `design/state.md`; `/start` *routes* you to the next skill. On a
  project with a healthy `state.md`, `/start` reads the same file —
  especially the `next-action` zone — and turns it into a recommended
  action. `/start` works even when `state.md` is absent by inspecting
  artefacts directly.
- Does not run cat-3 skills for you. When the next step is cat-3
  (`/issue-planner`, `/pr-review-packager`, `/release`,
  `/complete-milestone`), `/start` recommends it and explains the
  explicit-approval gate; it does not invoke it.

## Inputs

- **Optional:** a one-line `goal` hint ("plan a feature", "ship what I
  have", "close the milestone"). When given, it biases the
  recommendation toward the matching verb in the
  [verb layer](../../docs/workflow-control.md#3-the-human-facing-verb-layer).
- **Read (never modified):** `design/state.md` (especially the
  `next-action` zone), `design/prd.md`, `design/prd-normalized.md`,
  `design/mvp.md`, `design/build-out-plan.md`, `prompts/issue-*.md`,
  and — read-only — `git status` / `git log main..HEAD` and open PRs
  via `gh`.

## Output

A short brief naming:

1. **Active operating mode** — `interactive` (default), `assisted`, or
   `autonomous`, per
   [`docs/workflow-control.md` §1](../../docs/workflow-control.md#1-operating-modes).
   State it so the session's pre-authorisation is visible in one place.
2. **Where the project stands** — one line.
3. **Recommended next step** — the verb and its underlying skill, with a
   one-line reason.
4. **What it will do next** — for a cat-1 target, offer to invoke it
   directly; for cat-2/cat-3, recommend it and name the approval gate.

## Routing protocol

Resolve the **first** matching rule, top to bottom. Prefer the
`next-action` zone when it is present and actionable.

1. **`next-action` zone present and `skill` ≠ `none`.** If
   `design/state.md` has a `state:next-action` zone with a concrete
   skill and its `preconditions` hold and `blocked-by` is `none`,
   recommend that skill with those args. If a precondition is unmet or
   `blocked-by` is set, report the blocker instead and fall through to
   the artefact rules below for an alternative.
2. **No `design/prd.md` and no scoping artefacts.** Project is just an
   idea → recommend `/idea-to-prd` (the `/start`-as-onboarding case).
3. **A PRD exists but not normalized** (`design/prd.md` without
   `design/prd-normalized.md`) → recommend `/prd-normalizer`.
4. **Normalized PRD but no MVP** (`design/prd-normalized.md` without
   `design/mvp.md`) → recommend `/prd-to-mvp`.
5. **MVP and build-out plan but no GitHub backlog** → recommend
   `/backlog` (`/issue-planner`, cat-3 — recommend, do not invoke).
6. **A branch is ahead of `main`** (`git log main..HEAD` non-empty) and
   no open PR for it → recommend `/ship` (`/pr-review-packager`, cat-3).
7. **A prepared prompt exists** (`prompts/issue-NNN-*.md`) with no
   branch yet → recommend `/work` (`/claude-issue-executor`).
8. **An open issue is selected but has no prompt** → recommend
   `/prepare-issue NNN`.
9. **A milestone's issues are all merged** → recommend
   `/finish-milestone`.
10. **Mature project, user hint names a major feature** → recommend
    `/feature` (`/feature-prd`, see
    [ADR-049](../../design/adr/adr-049-follow-up-prd-workflow.md)).

### When the next step is ambiguous

If two or more rules plausibly apply and the `goal` hint does not break
the tie, **ask exactly one clarifying question** — e.g. *"You have a
prepared prompt for #95 and an open branch for #94 — continue #94's PR,
or start #95?"* — rather than dumping the full skill list. One question,
then route.

## Invoking vs. recommending

- **cat-1 target** (`/idea-to-prd`, `/prd-normalizer`, `/prd-to-mvp`,
  `/prepare-issue`, `/resume`, `/feature-prd`, …): offer to invoke it
  directly in the same session, honouring the active operating mode.
- **cat-2 target** (`/claude-issue-executor`): recommend it; it runs its
  own plan-mode rhythm and approval gate.
- **cat-3 target** (`/issue-planner`, `/pr-review-packager`, `/release`,
  `/complete-milestone`): recommend it and name the explicit-approval
  gate. Never invoke a cat-3 skill from `/start`.

See [`example.md`](example.md) for worked routings.

## Handoff

`/start` ends by naming the recommended skill. The user runs it (or
approves `/start` invoking a cat-1 target). After that skill finishes,
running `/start` again advances to the next step.
